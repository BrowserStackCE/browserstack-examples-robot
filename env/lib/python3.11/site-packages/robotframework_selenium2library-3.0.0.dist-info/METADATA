Selenium2Library
================

Selenium2Library is a web testing library for `Robot Framework`_
that uses the Selenium_ tool internally. The project is hosted on
GitHub_ and downloads can be found from PyPI_.

Starting from version 3.0, Selenium2Library is renamed to SeleniumLibrary_
and this project exists mainly to help with transitioning.

Versions
--------

Selenium2Library 3.0 and newer extend the new SeleniumLibrary_ and thus
contain exactly the same code and functionality. There have been lot of
internal changes in the library, but external functionality provided by
keywords should be fully backwards compatible. Libraries and tools using
Selenium2Library internally may need to be updated to support
Selenium2Library 3.0, though. Selenium2Library 1.8 is the latest, and last,
legacy version with the old architecture and code.

Selenium2Library 3.0 supports Python 2.7 as well as Python 3.3 and newer.
Selenium2Library 1.8 supports Python 2.6-2.7.

Keyword documentation

- `Selenium2Library 3.0`__ (latest)
- `Selenium2Library 1.8`__ (legacy)

Installation
------------

The recommended approach to install Selenium2Library, regardless the version,
is using pip_.

Install (or upgrade) the latest Selenium2Library version::

    pip install --upgrade robotframework-selenium2library

Install the legacy Selenium2Library 1.8.0 version::

    pip install robotframework-selenium2library==1.8.0

Migrating to SeleniumLibrary
----------------------------

Existing Selenium2Library users should start migrating to the
SeleniumLibrary_. For most users this should be a simple procedure:

1. Install the latest Selenium2Library as explained above. This installs
   both SeleniumLibrary and Selenium2Library, and in fact Selenium2Library
   is nowadays just a thin wrapper for SeleniumLibrary.

2. Execute tests normally to see are there problems.

3. If problems are encountered, try on investigate why they occur. Possible
   problems can be divided into two categories:

   - If a keyword provided by the library itself has changed, take a look at
     `SeleniumLibrary 3.0 release notes`_ to see is it a known backwards
     incompatible change. If it isn't, you may have encountered a regression
     that ought to be reported to `SeleniumLibrary issue tracker`_.

   - If a library using Selenium2Library does not work anymore, it is likely
     due to the large internal changes in SeleniumLibrary 3.0. Report the
     problem to the maintainers of the broken library or fix the problem
     yourself if you are the maintainer.

   Regardless the problem, you can always ask help on various `support
   channels`_.

4. If no problems occur or after problems have been resolved, you can start
   changing library imports to use ``SeleniumLibrary`` instead of
   ``Selenium2Library``. Also all keyword usages in form like
   ``Selenium2Library.Title Should Be`` need to be updated.

5. After test data has been updated, Selenium2Library installation can
   be removed altogether.
